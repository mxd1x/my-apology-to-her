        <h1>OI DAMN PRINCESS</h1>
        <p>LAVEENA</p>
        <p>I never meant to drop a bomb on our vibe,,<br>and I seriously didn't intend to mess with the cosmic order of things. <br> I feel like the moon and stars are giving me side-eye, and even the big guy upstairs has thrown some serious shade my way. Apparently, I've upset his daughter, and now I'm stuck in this awkward celestial timeout.

            I went to my usual secret spot, you know, the one with all the flowers and the birds belting out the hits in the morning. Well, today was a total bust. The flowers were all like, "Nope, not today," and the birds were on strike. It was like my own personal nature protest. <br> <br>
            
            I've been asking the universe for some guidance, and it basically said, "Hey, buddy, you messed up. If you really want things to get back to normal, you better go apologize to my daughter." So, here I am, doing my best to fix the cosmic fiasco I unintentionally caused.
            
            I hope we can fix this and  get back to the good times. <br><br>I miss the flowers blooming, the birds singing, and, most importantly, your awesome company.
            
            Take care, PRINCESS</p>
